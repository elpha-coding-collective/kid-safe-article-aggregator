# kid-safe-article-aggregator
First project: Reactjs web app for serving kid-safe news and info articles

# Problem being tackled: 
Kids are limited to informational content from their textbooks or Scholastic News. They are gated from 
adult-level news or information content like news articles or Wikipedia because they are considered untrustworthy or 
inappropriate for underage people. Now that kids have access to the entire internet on their phones and laptops, they will be 
engaging with even more content that they will either not understand or will be inappropriate or upsetting. 

# Solution
A webapp that lets kids search for and read news and information content that does not have inappropriate content for children. 
It will also allow kids to define and learn new terms or historical context. 

# UX Flow
* A user inputs a search term like 'volcanoes' or 'US presidential election'
* they're given a list of articles to read that have been pre-filtered
* users can read articles, and define words or terms in the article
